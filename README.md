# Smart Object Sorting Machine

The Smart Object Sorting Machine is a device designed to detect and sort objects based on their color and weight. The machine is pre-configured to identify and categorize around 3 to 4 colors, each having two different weight categories. The sorted objects are then placed into designated containers corresponding to their colors and weights.

## Features

- **Color Detection:** The machine utilizes color sensor to identify objects based on predefined color categories.
- **Weight Sensing:** Equipped with a precise weight sensing mechanism, the machine distinguishes between two weight categories for each color.
- **Object Sorting:** Efficiently sorts objects into designated containers based on both color and weight criteria.

## How It Works

1. **Object Placement:**
   - Place the object to be sorted on the input tray.

2. **Color Detection:**
   - The machine employs color detection technology to identify the color of the object.

3. **Weight Sensing:**
   - Precise weight sensors measure the weight of the object and categorize it into one of two predefined weight categories.

4. **Sorting Process:**
   - Based on the detected color and weight, the machine sorts the object into the corresponding container.

5. **Output:**
   - Retrieve the sorted objects from their designated containers.

## Configurations

The color and weight categories are pre-configured in advance. The machine is designed to handle 3 to 4 distinct colors, with each color having two different weight categories.

## Usage

The Smart Object Sorting Machine is ideal for scenarios where objects need to be efficiently sorted based on both color and weight criteria. It finds applications in industries such as logistics, manufacturing, and recycling.
